	<h1>About us</h1>
	<p>I Saw Bunnies in 2017 is a non-profit organization* founded to attest the fact that I did see bunnies in 2017. 2017 was not the only time I've seen bunnies in my life, and
	I've seen them since, but I happen to have pictures of these bunnies (see the "Photos" page for more details).</p>
	<p>In case you were wondering why there is Japanese text, it's just to practice using it in HTML and CSS.</p>
	<p id="disclaimer">*Please note that 'I Saw Bunnies in 2017' is not actually an organization.</p>
